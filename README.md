# Project3

Some theory:

`Assembler:
1. Number of contigs (we care only about large contigs)
2. Lenght of contigs ~ coverage
3. Critera: N=50, GC content, ref length ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment] [http://topicpageswiki.plos.org/wiki/K-mer] )
4. If there a extremely different contig -> it is a plasmid
5. How can we fix errors: k-mers distribution (trimmomatic) or use many k-mers`

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Homework:
 1. How many k-mers? (see k-mers distrivution) 
 2. Why allignment does not work? (assemlly, find relatives, find differences, how thew evolved, goe they became pathogens?)

we will use SPADes, BLAST, annotate it
